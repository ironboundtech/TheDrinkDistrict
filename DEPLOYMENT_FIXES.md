# Deployment Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Product Image Display Issue
**Problem**: Uploaded product images were not being displayed correctly in the frontend.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend was storing full file paths (e.g., `/uploads/products/product-123.jpg`)
- Frontend was incorrectly trying to construct URLs by prepending the base URL to the full path
- This resulted in incorrect URLs like `https://api.com/uploads/products/product-123.jpg`

**Solution**:
- Modified frontend to extract the relative path starting from `uploads/`
- Added `startsWith('http')` check for robustness
- Added `onError` handling for fallback to placeholder images

**Files Modified**: `frontend/src/app.tsx`
- Updated product image `src` attribute construction
- Added error handling for image loading

### 2. Top Up Wallet Issue
**Problem**: 
- Top-up functionality was not working due to "undefined" user ID
- After successful top-up, wallet balance was not being displayed correctly

**Root Cause**:
- **User ID Mismatch**: Frontend was using `currentUser.id` while backend expected `currentUser._id`
- **Login/Register Functions**: Set `currentUser.id` instead of `currentUser._id`
- **Wallet Balance Display**: Cache invalidation and state synchronization issues

**Solution**:
- **Fixed User ID Consistency**: Changed all instances of `currentUser.id` to `currentUser._id` (12 locations)
- **Updated Login/Register Functions**: Set `_id: user._id` instead of `id: user._id`
- **Enhanced Wallet Balance Management**: Added `fetchWalletBalance()` call after successful top-up
- **Improved Cache Invalidation**: Better cache clearing strategy
- **Added Debugging**: Console logging for troubleshooting

**Files Modified**: `frontend/src/app.tsx`
- Updated all `currentUser.id` references to `currentUser._id`
- Fixed `handleLogin` and `handleRegister` functions
- Enhanced `handleTopUp` function with proper balance refresh
- Added console logging for debugging

### 3. Placeholder Image Issue
**Problem**: Placeholder images were returning 404 errors due to incorrect URL construction.

**Root Cause**: Hardcoded relative paths were not working with the deployed API URL.

**Solution**: Updated all placeholder image URLs to use `config.apiBaseUrl` for proper URL construction.

**Files Modified**: `frontend/src/app.tsx`
- Replaced hardcoded `/api/placeholder/` paths with `${config.apiBaseUrl}/placeholder/`

## Affected Files
1. `frontend/src/app.tsx` - Main application file with all fixes

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Render
- Upload the updated `build` folder to your Render deployment
- Ensure environment variables are properly set:
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL`
  - `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
- Clear browser cache to ensure new assets are loaded
- Test with incognito/private browsing mode

## Testing Instructions

### Product Images
1. Upload a new product image
2. Verify the image displays correctly in the product list
3. Check that the image URL is properly constructed
4. Verify fallback to placeholder if image fails to load

### Top Up Wallet
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to Wallet page
3. Click "Top Up" button
4. Select amount and payment method
5. Complete top-up process
6. **Expected Results**:
   - Top-up completes successfully
   - Wallet balance updates immediately
   - Balance displays correctly in UI
   - No console errors about undefined user ID

### Placeholder Images
1. Check that placeholder images load correctly
2. Verify no 404 errors in console
3. Test with different image sizes

## Expected Results
- ✅ Product images display correctly after upload
- ✅ Top-up functionality works without errors
- ✅ Wallet balance displays correctly after top-up
- ✅ Placeholder images load without 404 errors
- ✅ No "undefined" user ID errors in console
- ✅ All functionality works consistently

## Additional Notes
- Console logging has been added for debugging wallet balance issues
- Cache invalidation has been improved for better data consistency
- User ID consistency has been standardized across the application
- Error handling has been enhanced for better user experience
